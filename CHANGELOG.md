# Changelog

## TYPO3 Installer for 11 LTS - 01.2022

### Removed packages

- `lavitto/form-to-database` is not available for TYPO3 11 yet
- `t3/fluid_page_cache` is not available for TYPO3 11 yet (seems abandoned)

### New packages

- `dirkpersky/typo3-dp_http2`: Provides HTTP2 Push for assets

### Notes:

- Currently, no stable release of `gridelementsteam/gridelements` compatible with TYPO3 11 is available. We therefore 
use a dev version in the meantime.
